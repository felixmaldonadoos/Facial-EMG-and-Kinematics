# Facial-EMG-and-Kinematics

# PERSONAL PROJECT - WORK IN PROGRESS

Studying facial muscle activation and their relationship with facial kinematics via facial landmarks. Utilizes an Arduino to generate a square wave with a specific duty cycle 
and frequency and synchronously trigger EMG and image acquisition.

This repo is meant for me to track my progress in analyzing and structuring a class to preprocess and extract information from electromyogram (EMG) and kinematic data 
(orofacial landmark data).
